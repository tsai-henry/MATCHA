    p.s. From website: https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/man/html/openxr.html.
         You can find **(Left/Right Wrist) XR/AppleVisionPro Convention** related information like this below:
           "The wrist joint is located at the pivot point of the wrist, which is location invariant when twisting the hand without moving the forearm. 
            The backward (+Z) direction is parallel to the line from wrist joint to middle finger metacarpal joint, and points away from the finger tips. 
            The up (+Y) direction points out towards back of the hand and perpendicular to the skin at wrist. 
            The X direction is perpendicular to the Y and Z directions and follows the right hand rule."
         Note: The above context is of course under **(basis) OpenXR Convention**.

    p.s. **(Wrist/Hand URDF) Unitree Convention** information come from URDF files.
